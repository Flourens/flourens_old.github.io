By subscribing to the service, you represent that the software will be used only in a lawful manner.  If the OpenALPR software cannot be used lawfully in your jurisdiction (including cases where OpenALPR software processes, transmits, or retains data that would violate local laws), you must discontinue use of Services immediately and uninstall any associated OpenALPR software.  OpenALPR is not liable for your use of license plate recognition technology in an unlawful manner.

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><i>Agent License.</i></strong>  Use of any of our software agents and associated documentation that is made available via the Site or the Services (each an <strong>&#8220;Agent&#8221;</strong>) is governed by the terms of the license agreement that accompanies or is included with the Agent, or by the license agreement expressly stated on the Site page(s) accompanying the Agent.  These license terms may be posted with the Agent downloads or at the Site page where the Agent can be accessed.  You will not use, download or install any Agent that is accompanied by or includes a license agreement unless you agree to the terms of such license agreement. At no time will OpenALPR provide you with any tangible copy of an Agent.  OpenALPR shall deliver access to the Agents via electronic transfer or download and shall not use or deliver any tangible media in connection with the (i) delivery, installation, updating or problem resolution of any Agents (including any new releases); or (b) delivery, correction or updating of documentation.  Unless the accompanying license agreement expressly allows otherwise, any copying or redistribution of the Agents is prohibited, including any copying or redistribution of the Agents to any other server or location, or redistribution or use on a service bureau basis.  If there is any conflict between the Terms and the license agreement, the license agreement shall take precedence in relation to that Agent (except as provided in the following sentence).  If the Agent is a pre-release or beta version, then, except for anything to the contrary included within an accompanying license agreement, you are not permitted to use or otherwise rely on the Agent for any commercial purposes.  If no license agreement accompanies use of the Agent, use of the Agent will be governed by the Terms.  Subject to your compliance with the Terms, OpenALPR grants you a non-assignable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-exclusive license to use the Agents for the sole purpose of enabling you to use the Services in the manner permitted by the Terms.

OpenALPR is not responsible for the operation or functionality of such Third Party Technology. You are solely responsible for your use of any Third Party Technology. In addition, we may provide you with software governed by an open source license. If there are provisions in those open source licenses that expressly conflict with these Terms, the relevant open source license terms will apply.  ANY THIRD PARTY TECHNOLOGY DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE OpenALPR PROPERTIES IS DONE SO AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR AND HEREBY WAIVE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS AND CAUSES OF ACTION WITH RESPECT TO ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM, INTERNET ACCESS, DOWNLOAD OR DISPLAY DEVICE, OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OF ANY SUCH THIRD PARTY TECHNOLOGY.
</p>

</p>

<p>
  <strong>4. The Service is Available &#8220;AS-IS&#8221; AND WITHOUT WARRANTY.</strong>  OpenALPR PROVIDES THE OpenALPR PROPERTIES &#8220;AS IS&#8221; AND ON AN &#8220;AS AVAILABLE&#8221; BASIS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, OpenALPR MAY OFFER NEW &#8220;BETA&#8221; FEATURES OR TOOLS WITH WHICH USERS MAY EXPERIMENT.  SUCH FEATURES OR TOOLS ARE OFFERED SOLELY FOR EXPERIMENTAL PURPOSES AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY IND, AND MAY BE MODIFIED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME AT OUR SOLE DISCRETION.  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION APPLY WITH FULL FORCE TO SUCH FEATURES AND TOOLS.  Some states do not allow the types of disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>5. OpenALPR’s Limitation of Liability.</strong>  TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL OpenALPR, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL (INCLUDING LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS, OR PROFITS) DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT OpenALPR HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. OpenALPR’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES, THE SITE, THE AGENTS AND THE FORUMS WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $50) OR THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID TO OpenALPR IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE INCIDENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM. THE LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN OpenALPR AND YOU.

  <strong>10. Export Control.</strong>  You may not use, export, import or transfer the OpenALPR Properties except as authorized by U.S. law, the laws of the jurisdiction in which you obtained the OpenALPR Properties and any other applicable laws.  In particular, but without limitation, the OpenALPR Properties may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any United States embargoed countries, or (b) to anyone of the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Person’s List or Entity List.  By using the OpenALPR Properties, you represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a &#8220;terrorist supporting&#8221; country and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.  You also will not use the OpenALPR Properties for any purpose prohibited by U.S. law, including the development, design, manufacture or production of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.  You acknowledge and agree that products, services or technology provided by OpenALPR are subject to the export control laws and regulations of the United States.  You shall comply with these laws and regulations and shall not, without prior U.S. government authorization, export, re-export, or transfer the OpenALPR Properties, or any portion thereof, either directly or indirectly, to any country in violation of such laws and regulations.

  <strong>11. Government Use.</strong>  If you are a U.S. government entity, you acknowledge that any Services provided are "Commercial Items" as defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, and are being provided as commercial computer software subject to the restricted rights described in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 and 12.212.

<p>
  <strong>13. General Terms.</strong>  These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between OpenALPR and you with respect to the Services and supersede and replace any other agreements, terms and conditions applicable to the Services. These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between OpenALPR and you with respect to the OpenALPR Properties and supersede and replace any other agreements, terms and conditions applicable to the Services. Purchase orders placed by you shall be for the sole purpose of specifying the Commercial Services that you wish to purchase.  Any other terms stated in any purchase order delivered to OpenALPR by you, other than pursuant to an Order Form supplied by OpenALPR, shall have no effect. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights. OpenALPR’s failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights in these Terms, and any such attempt is void, but OpenALPR may assign its rights to any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services. You and OpenALPR are not legal partners or agents; but rather we have an independent contractor relationship.  OpenALPR will not be responsible for any failure to perform or delay in performing any of its obligations under these Terms where and to the extent that such failure or delay results directly or indirectly from an event beyond OpenALPR’s reasonable control.
