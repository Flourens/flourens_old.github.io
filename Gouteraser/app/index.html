							Hi my name is Robert Miller. And just three years ago, I was crying my eyes out like a little girl. And I just couldn’t stop.

							<br/><br/> Why, you ask? Because the tip of my bedsheet pulled on my big toe, as I was preparing for bed.

							<br/><br/> For a normal person, this trivial amount of pressure would be so light they wouldn’t even notice it as they drifted off to sleep.

							<br/><br/> But I was brought to tears. <b><i>“It hurts so bad!”</i></b> I yelled out in agony.

							<br/><br/> “Teddy’s here for you, Daddy! It’ll all go away soon.”

							<br/><br/> I smiled, holding back my embarrassment.

							<br/><br/> I have a loving family, something I’m very grateful for. But the unwanted spotlight brought on by the excruciating pain of an inflamed toe was almost worst than the pain itself.

							<br/><br/> I’ve been holding off going to the doctor, but after the incident with the bedsheet, I could wait no longer. I visited first thing in the morning, shockwaves of pain striking me with every step I made towards the doctor’s office...

							He said that there was a build-up of uric acid crystals in between the joints of my big toes. He said he was surprised I’d gone as long as I had without visiting, given my symptoms.

							<br/><br/> I smiled sheepishly, not knowing what to say. I guess I felt a bit neglectful. Sometimes I wonder if doctors know how self-conscious they can make you feel with these offhand remarks.

				<div class="small-12 columns" style='margin-top:1.2em'>

					5 minutes passed and we were already at the end of the visit. Without taking another look in my direction, the doctor hurriedly scribbled a steroidal medication prescription, and instructed me to take 2 pills a day. The cost was $250 a month. I prayed this prescription wouldn’t last long.

					<br/><br/>





					<center><img class="width55" src="img/img5.jpg"></center>

					<br/> “It’s certainly not an overnight fix,” he said, reading my mind. I contemplated the cost and figured my little girl’s ski trip with her friends would probably have to be put off this year.

					<br/><br/> Now I am most definitely not a selfish dad, but I really didn’t know if I could survive another bedsheet episode again.

					<br/><br/> Unfortunately the pharmacists seemed to know that too, from the prices they charged.

					<br/><br/> After buying my first bottle and heading home, I sat down and stared at the clock for a good 10 minutes. Were the meds working? Was the swelling going down?

					<br/><br/> Slowly but surely, <u>things did begin to change</u>. But just not in the way I’d hoped for.

					<br/><br/>

							<br/><br/> I couldn’t watch the clock any longer. I felt myself getting unusually frustrated as I stormed downstairs to check on my little girl.

						<br/>

					</div>



					“Suzie!” <b>I yelled</b>. “For Christ’s sake, turn that stupid cartoon off and do your homework right now, young lady!”

					<br/><br/>

					<br/> She started to cry as she ran to her room. She was confused. So was I.

					<br/><br/> My wife, catching my outburst, pulled me to the side and told me that the medications were getting to my head. And that maybe I should go outside.

					<br/><br/> To be honest, I think she might have been a bit scared.

					<br/><br/> Heading outside, the next conversation I <b><u>would have would completely change my life</u></b>, and <b><u>unlock the secret to all natural gout removal.</u></b> All from an unusual accomplice from my high school past.

					<br/><br/> “Robert? Is that you?” a female voice remarked.

					<br/>
					<br/> “Hi Sofia! How have you been?” She was one of my neighbors from down the street. We were close friends in high school, but as neighbors we might have spoken once or twice a year at most.

					<br/>
					<br/> I’m a married man, mind you. And you can be sure that my conversation with Sofia was entirely platonic in nature.

					<br/><br/>



					<center><img class="width60" src="img/img7.jpg"></center>

					<br/> But as a male I’ll also say Sofia was quite attractive for her age, quite thin and fit despite being in her late 30s like I was.

					<br/>
					<br/> We had the typical neighborly small talk, and then the conversation found its way to my struggles with gout. I told her about the medications and how they caused an outburst with my young daughter.

					<br/><br/> Now, there’s something you need to know about Sofia. She practiced as a ‘health consultant’ and had built up a rep in our neighbourhood as a miracle healer.

					<br/>
					<br/> You’re probably smirking at the term ‘miracle healer’ and that’s always how I had felt about it too. And I’ll tell you more – despite being a straight A student in high school, Sofia had not attended university after that and all we knew was that she had instead moved to Japan for 8 years and then came back with ‘weird ideas’.

					<br/>
					<br/> So yes, I had never really took her seriously before that day and I would have never thought of going to someone who was not a doctor – let alone someone without a university degree - for health advice! But on that day, a lot of things changed...

					<br/><br/> Our conversation got very personal. She said that both her parents had died young – her mother from diabetes complications and her father from a sudden heart attack.

					<br/><br/> That had affected her greatly. Particularly the fact that despite going to top doctors, no one was able to save her parents. And that had caused her to reject all conventional knowledge and seek answers in an unlikely place...

					<br/><br/> Remember I said we knew she had moved to Japan? Technically, it was Okinawa, an island off the coast of the Japan.

					<br/><br/><br/>



					<center><img class="width50" src="img/img8.jpg"></center>

					<br/>



					<div class='fontblue' style="">

						<center>If it sounds familiar, that is because <br/>Okinawa has recently been in the news<br/> as the place with
							<font class="darkred">the longest life expectancy</font>

						</center>

					</div>

					<br/>

					<br/> In fact, it has been reported that there are four times as many centenarians in Okinawa as there are in America and Britain, and Dr. Willcox, a scientist researching this extraordinary phenomenon, has recently said about the island’s inhabitants that "The calendar may say they're 70 but their body says they're 50,"...and..."The most impressive part of it is that a good lot of them are healthy until the very end &quot;...

					<br/><br/>

					<center><img style='margin-top:0.2em;margin-bottom:0.2em' class="width50" src="img/img9.jpg"></center>

					<br/> Now Sofia had gone to Okinawa before Western media caught on that something was special about the health of its inhabitants. She said that in Asia, Okinawa is well known to be the go-to place for answers when it comes to extraordinary health, and in fact the Chinese have referred to Okinawa as the “Land of the Immortals” for centuries.

					<br/>
					<br/> By this point, Kassie had my full attention. And then she dropped the bomb:

					<br/><br/>

					<div class='fontblue' style="">

						<center>“You know, in Okinawa gout is deemed to<br/> be
							<font class="darkred">a very easily treatable ailment</font>” <br> <br>

						</center>

					</div>

					<br/> “I myself have helped many people free themselves of gout; I can show you how <strong><u>right now</u></strong>” <br/><br/>

				</div>



				<div class="small-12 columns" style='margin-top:1.2em'>

					<div class="small-7 columns " style="padding-left: 0px !important;">

						<h1 class='font_text' style="margin-top:0.4em;">

							She continued to explain that gout was just the result of a waste product in our bodies, and our bodies are more than capable of getting rid of that, given the right tools and stimuli...

							<br/><br/> I replied: “But the doctor said...”

							<br/><br/> Her gentle smile stopped me mid sentence. “Will you hear me out for 15 minutes”, she asked?



						</h1>

					</div>

					<div class="small-5 columns">

						<img src="img/img10.jpg">

					</div>

				</div>



				<div class="small-12 columns" style='margin-top:1.2em'>



					Those next 15 minutes would completely change my life and the way I think about health. Her advice was incredibly simple and consisted of just 3 main things:

					<br/><br/>



					<center><img class="width90" src="img/img11.jpg"></center>

					<br/><br/> And that was it...she promised me this crazy but weird approach would rid me of my gout FAST...

					<br/><br/> I thanked her and rushed back home, half excited and half dazed by the knowledge she had just dropped on me.

					<br/><br/> By that night, the pain had lessened from grade suicidal to ‘mere’ throbbing, which was a huge improvement for me.

					<br/><br/> Next morning, I could walk normally and the swelling had visibly gone down.

					<br/><br/>



					<div class='fontblue'>

						<center>And a whole 7 days later,<br/> to my amazement not only was
							<font class="darkred">my gout<br/> completely gone</font>, but I was also feeling<br/> strangely rejuvenated and more energetic<br/> than I had felt in a long, long time. <br><br>

						</center>

					</div>

					<br/> My wife and daughter were super proud of me. I’d solved my issue not with quick fix drugs, but by providing my body with the right conditions to get rid a waste product, just like Sofia had said.

					<br/><br/> I have to tell you that this experience was completely life changing for me. The freedom from pain was totally liberating. I was suddenly free again to go wherever I pleased and spend time with friends and family.

					<br/><br/> The embarrassment of being weak and fragile in front of my family was replaced by a new form of strength and confidence in my health. Something I found others complimenting me about as well.

					<br/><br/> My wife Brenda told me with romantic eyes, that she hadn’t seen me this happy and energetic in over a decade.

					<br/><br/> My young girl also knows that dad is able to take charge of his health. It’s a duty of a good father to provide a good example to his children how to protect their own health, and one I’m happy to finally make good on.

					<br/><br/> Forget synthetic drugs and Western therapies. Sofia showed me a better path to address the pains, and slowly let them wither away on their own, like a dying weed.

					<br/>
					<br/> Hopefully by now, you know that there is a better path to solving your own gout issues. Even as my own story unfolded, I have to tell you that I was half in disbelief as my pains left my body.

					<br/><br/> Forget paying ridiculous fees for overpriced, side effect -producing medications…

					<br/><br/> Instead, we’ll simply give your body exactly what it needs to re-start removing excess uric acid as it had been doing all along before gout kicked in.

					<br/><br/> After my incredibly experience, I asked Sofia if she’d be happy for me to write all her secrets down to pass them on to others, and she was more than happy to help.

					<br/>
					<br/> Our hope is that these teachings will eventually help millions of Americans to put a stop to our endless drug culture, and address the underlying issues for gout right at home.

						<b>Final Note From The Author Of The Gout Eraser™…</b>

						<br/><br/> I have a confession: I never intended to write a book on anything, let alone gout.

						<br/><br/> But my first-hand experience of knowing how crippling of a problem this can be led me to a simple truth:

						<br/><br/><br/>

						<b>I Couldn't Sit Around Knowing That My Issue Was Cured, While Many Others Continued To Suffer</b>

						<br/><br/> That's why I wrote this book.

						<br/><br/> That's why I went into great detail to explain the right approach to take to actually make a difference.

						<br/><br/> That's why I offer it for the low price I do.

						<br/><br/> Because I want you to have a happy and healthy life that you can share with your family. I'd like you to be sciatica free.

						<br/><br/> From my family to yours, I wish you a warm and speedy recovery,

						<br/><br/><br/><br/>
