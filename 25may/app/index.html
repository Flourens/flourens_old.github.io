					<br/> Nearly every family in the US has at least one family member affected by this dreadful illness.

					<br/><br/> I was diagnosed three years ago at 41, and ever since have depended on my lovely wife and young son to take me around. My sciatica was so severe that my legs would lock up in fits of excruciating pain. You can imagine the problems this could cause while driving.

					<br/><br/> Instead, I sat by and watched my wife Joanne do the man's work for me. We both knew that I was too high risk of setting off my over-sensitized nerves…
					<br/><br/> …dropping everything and causing a mess while I lay helplessly and painfully on the floor.
					<br/><br/> It was just dreadful all around. Sciatica is the most emasculating disease you can imagine.

						Of course like any American in the US, I went straight to the doctor for my health issue. Right away the good doc prescribed some pain medications and told me to get in touch with a chiropractor for adjustments.
						<br/><br/> I was using a cocktail of analgesics, muscle relaxants and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories…they gave me some minor temporary relief and lots of stomach cramps and diarrhea…great!
						<br/><br/> At the chiropractor, often the pains flared up right during the session, and more often than not, I’d walk out worse, not better. But I figured it was all worth it, in order to be able to experience the simple joys of life with my family again.

						<br/> Lucky for me, my wife is close to a lovely Nepalese elderly woman who happens to have been a healer in her days. One day, my wife brought home her friend Xie to come see me.

							<br/> What Xie did to me in the next 15 minutes was nothing short of miraculous. Her approach was dead simple, yet the immediate results were jaw dropping. It was as if she had literally reached into my painful nerves and fixed them, much like an electrician replacing faulty wires..
							<br/><br/> Comparing those 15 minutes to the two years of Western treatments I had been on, it was clear which sciatica treatment worked, and which one was nothing but empty promises.
							<br/><br/> Xie told me all I had to do was to repeat what she had done for the next few days and <strong>the pain would be gone completely by the end of the week.</strong> It was an impressive claim, but from what I had already experienced in just 15 minutes I was convinced. <br/><br/>

									<h1 class='font_testi'>I can’t thank you enough Glenn. I was a sciatica sufferer for years and had wasted thousands of dollars on all kinds of therapies and medications, from epidural injections to chiropractic treatments. I’d get temporary relief but after a few days the pain would be back. It had gotten to the point where tying my own shoe laces had become a pain-staking 10 minute task. A friend of mine sent me a link to Sciatica SOS on facebook and barely <b>5 days later the pain was gone completely and I have my mobility back.</b> One month later I am still completely pain-free. This should be a must to anyone with sciatica.</h1>

            Sciatica SOS™</strong> is the only guide to show you exactly how to cure your sciatica naturally and permanently. You may be asking how much such a life-changing system is going to cost you? First, let me ask you - how much are you willing to pay to get rid of your sciatica and constant pain FOREVER? <br/><br/> Now, keep in mind that just a visit to your specialist costs $150 to $200+. If you opt for chiropractic adjustments, these will easily cost you hundreds of dollars over a course of treatment…
							<br/><br/> But <strong>Sciatica SOS™</strong> will cost you <strong>NOWHERE</strong> near that! You see, I want to give you this life-changing ebook for just $37! <br/><br/> This a fraction of the cost of a single doctor's visit -- and let's not even talk about the cost of the pills and therapy visits you're likely to incur.
							<br/><br/> Remember, you are not only getting the Sciatica SOS™ e-book and 5 bonus ebooks, but you are also getting free lifetime updates - <strong>all for just $37 </strong><br/><br/> But don't thank me just yet. I will be putting the price up to $69.99 soon, but first I want to make sure that the people who really need this system have a chance to get it at this ridiculously low price. So don't wait one minute to order at this bargain price!
							<br/><br/> Once you place your order on Clickbanks's secure server, you will get instant access to this best selling guide, even if it's 3 in the morning. Sciatica SOS™ is in digital format (PDF) which means that there is no need to wait for it to arrive. You will be able to learn the secrets of curing your sciatica, in just minutes from now. </h1>

									<h1 class='font_testi'>Wow your system works like magic! My sciatica started when I lifted 300lbs on the Deadlift for 3 reps about a year ago. The doctor said I had an L4-L5 bulging disc which apparently was ok after 4 months but the pain in my glute down to my ankle was unbearable and I obviously had to stop the gym completely. I tried muscle imbalance therapy, enzymes, creams, catafast, advil, ibuprofen and chiropractic adjustment but nothing seems to work. I downloaded your book last week and immediately got started and I <b>could feel improvement from the very first day.</b> I have now NO pain at all and I plan to re-start gym next week (slowly of course).

									<h1 class='font_testi'>Your system is a God-send Mr. Johnson! I bought this for my 78 year old mother, who had been suffering from sciatica on-and-off for over 6 years. Each time she'd see the doc, he d give her a course of anti-inflammatories (usually Celebrex or Catafast). This would make her feel better for a few weeks, but then the pain would be back... <br>
										<br>I was worried about the side effects of these medications, and that's when I found your system. It was extremely easy to follow and the instructions were laid out in a very simple manner. My mum had no problem following it at all, and <br>
										<strong>barely a week later she had no pain!!!</strong></b> She has now been pain-free for 5 months already, God bless you and your family!
